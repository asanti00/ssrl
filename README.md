Mission Name: AquaLens
Objective: Monitoring Harmful Algal Blooms using Hyperspectral Imaging

## Overview

AquaLens is a 3U CubeSat mission dedicated to the real-time monitoring and tracking of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in coastal and freshwater ecosystems. Using advanced hyperspectral imaging technology, AquaLens aims to mitigate the environmental, economic, and public health risks posed by HABs, especially in regions dependent on fisheries, drinking water, and tourism.

This mission focuses on providing near-real-time data to researchers, policymakers, and local communities to enhance early warning systems and inform effective mitigation efforts.
